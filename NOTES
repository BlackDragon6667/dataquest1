Future changes (TODO):
    * Twitter link currently points to browserquest.mozilla.org
    * Replace code references to match the objects, mobs, items and achievements added in dataquest
    * Add extra characters representing different people in-game.
        * Make characters obvious with prefixed names when they speak "Name:".
    * Additional game mechanics:
        * Quest system: Collect objects or sample mobs and talk to characters for gifts.
        * Achievements with more focus on teamplay (jointly kill a mob)
